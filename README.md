# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```
for working frontend
```
npx hardhat node
```
in a different terminal
```
npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
If you wish to see it in the frontend then

```shell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Make sure to put the contract addresses in frontend/src/constants/contracts.ts comming from ./scripts/deploy.js
